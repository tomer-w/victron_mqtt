"""Testing utilities for victron_mqtt.

This module provides helper functions and utilities for testing code that
uses the victron_mqtt library. Downstream projects can import these utilities
to write their own tests involving Hub objects and MQTT message simulation.

Example:
    ```python
    from victron_mqtt.testing import create_mocked_hub, inject_message, finalize_injection
    
    async def test_my_integration():
        hub = await create_mocked_hub()
        await inject_message(hub, "N/123/battery/0/Soc", '{"value": 85}')
        await finalize_injection(hub)
        
        # Your test assertions here
        assert len(hub.devices) == 1
    ```
